# PROFILE #

Hello this is Yuta Nakamura. I am a Ph.D. candidate at DePaul University (almost in the 3rd year).
I have an enormous curiosity out in this world, and wish to create a business that would be change the game in some industries. 

# RESEARCH #

I am currently in computer systems, which does things related to compilers, operating systems, database, etc... I am currently working on research of program analysis. To be more specific, I am trying to create this software to detect the point of divergence/reconvergence of two executions. We are currently assuming those differences occur because of provenances of the 2 executions. 

I love research in a sense that I get to control what I do at my own time schedule, though sometimes it gets packed before the deadlines. 

## PUBLISHED WORK ##

Below are the published work I have so far

### Content Defined Merkle Tree ###
As I was to implement Merkle tree in [Sciunit](https://sciunit.run/), I realized that Merkle tree cannot be used for blocks that are created with Content-Defined Chunking method. Therefore we came up with the idea of CDMT, which does the Content-Defined Chunking in the internal nodes. This data structure is now robust against the chunk-shift, which occurs using the Merkle trees on top of content-defined chunks.

### Efficient Provenance Alignment in Reproduced Executions ###
[SPADE](https://github.com/ashish-gehani/SPADE) and Sciunit use system calls to trace the provenance of the executions. Therefore this is our first attempt to look at the system call trace to make sure the two executions are aligned.
