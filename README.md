# PROFILE #

Hello this is Yuta Nakamura. I am a Ph.D. candidate at DePaul University (almost in the 3rd year).
I have an enormous curiosity out in this world, and wish to create a business that would be change the game in some industries. 

# RESEARCH #

I am currently in computer systems, which does things related to compilers, operating systems, database, etc... I am currently working on research of program analysis. To be more specific, I am trying to create this software to detect the point of divergence/reconvergence of two executions. We are currently assuming those differences occur because of provenances of the 2 executions. 

I love research in a sense that I get to control what I do at my own time schedule, though sometimes it gets packed before the deadlines. 

# HOBBIES #

I love studying and playing chess and other strategic board games, so if you are interested, befriend me and play against me!
