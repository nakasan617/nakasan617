# PROFILE #

Hello this is Yuta Nakamura. I am a Ph.D. candidate at DePaul University (almost in the 3rd year).
I have an enormous curiosity out there and I wish to create some business that would change the game in an industry.

# RESEARCH #

I am currently in computer systems, which does things related to compilers, operating systems, database, etc... I am currently working on research of program analysis. To be more specific, I am trying to create this software to detect the point of divergence/reconvergence of two executions. We are currently assuming those differences occur because of provenances of the 2 executions. 

I love research in a sense that I get to control what I do at my own time schedule, though sometimes it gets packed before the deadlines. 

## PUBLISHED WORK ##

Below are the published work I have so far

### Provenance-based Workflow Diagnostics Using Program Specification ###
To increase the repeatability of the workflow system, we have created a tool called ProvScope. Whenever some workflow executions show unexpected outputs, ProvScope compares with same workflow with expected outputs (from a different input) to narrow down the bugs of the workflows. ProvScope uses program specifications to precisely find the points of divergence of the executions, and to deal with the path explosion problem to identify the path in the program specifications from traces, function call traces are used in a hierarchical manner to reduce the search space.

### Content Defined Merkle Tree (2021) ###
As I was to implement Merkle tree in [Sciunit](https://sciunit.run/), I realized that Merkle tree cannot be used for blocks that are created with Content-Defined Chunking method. Therefore we came up with the idea of CDMT, which does the Content-Defined Chunking in the internal nodes. This data structure is now robust against the chunk-shift, which occurs using the Merkle trees on top of content-defined chunks.

### Efficient Provenance Alignment in Reproduced Executions (2020) ###
[SPADE](https://github.com/ashish-gehani/SPADE) and Sciunit use system calls to trace the provenance of the executions. Therefore this is our first attempt to look at the system call trace to make sure the two executions are aligned.

# HOBBIES #

I love studying and playing chess and other strategic board games, so if you are interested, befriend me and play against me! 
My rating is around 1500 in rapid (10 min) for chess.
